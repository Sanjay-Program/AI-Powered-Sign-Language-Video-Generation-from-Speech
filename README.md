# AI-Powered Sign Language Video Generation from Speech

This project converts **spoken language into sign language videos** using **AI-powered speech recognition, NLP, and image processing**. It enhances communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts speech to text using `speech_recognition`.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extracts key words from speech using `nltk`.
- **Sign Language Image Mapping**: Finds corresponding sign images for words from a dataset.
- **Video Generation**: Compiles sign images into a video using `OpenCV`.
- **Audio Narration**: Uses `gTTS` to generate spoken audio for accessibility.
- **AI Integration**: Enhances sign translation accuracy using machine learning.
