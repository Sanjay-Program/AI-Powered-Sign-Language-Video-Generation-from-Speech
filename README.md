# AI-Powered-Sign-Language-Video-Generation-from-Speech
# Speech-to-Sign Language Video Conversion

This project is designed to **convert spoken language into sign language videos**, bridging communication gaps for individuals with hearing impairments. It utilizes **speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and image processing** to generate sign language visuals.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text using `speech_recognition`.
- **Text Processing with NLP**: Filters and extracts key words using `nltk`.
- **Sign Language Image Mapping**: Matches words with corresponding **sign language images** from a dataset.
- **Video Generation**: Creates a **sign language video** using `OpenCV`.
- **Audio Integration**: Adds speech narration to the generated video using `gTTS`.

## Installation
### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sign-language-video.git
